\section{about me}

I've been developing software for over 10 years, from web apps to embedded platforms. \\
During this time I've come to believe:
- Empathy first, always
- Trust is key
- Less is more

On the tech side of things, I'm more of a backend/operations type, but I do dabble a bit on the frontend.
I enjoy taking part and ownership of where and how applications are deployed and monitored.

I take pride in being part of team. I enjoy giving talks and getting to know people at conferences.
I've been a team lead before, and I dislike the term "soft skills". Once you're in a position as such, those so called "soft" skills are exactly what is most important.
